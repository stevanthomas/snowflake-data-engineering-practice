# snowflake-data-engineering-practice
This repository was created for hands on practice on Snowflake using dbt and Airflow


You can find the tutorial here (https://quickstarts.snowflake.com/guide/data_engineering_with_apache_airflow/index.html?index=..%2F..index#0)

At the time of repository creation, I was learning Snowflake and was looking to get the Snowpro Core certification. ALthough this wasn't covered in the exam, it piqued my interest. Might consider getting the data engineer one next.
